# Clustering_Assignments

Clustering-Assignments Executed Hierarchical, KMEANS, DBSCAN Clustering on two datasets  
**East/West Airlines **

**Crime **

East/West Airlines Executed Clustering (Hierarchical, KMEANS, DBSCAN) to acquire optimum number of clusters. Draw the inferences from the clusters acquired.

Data Description: 
The file EastWestAirlinescontains information on passengers who belong to an airlineâ€™s frequent flier program.  
For each passenger the data include information on their mileage history and on different ways they accrued or spent miles in the last year. 
The goal is to try to identify clusters of passengers that have similar characteristics for the purpose of targeting different segments for different types of mileage offers 
ID --Unique ID  

Balance Number of miles eligible for award travel  
Qual mile Number of miles counted as qualifying for Topflight status 
cc1 miles Number of miles earned with freq. flyer credit card in the past 12 months.
cc2 miles Number of miles earned with Rewards credit card in the past 12 months.
cc3 miles Number of miles earned with Small Business credit card in the past 12 months.
1 = under 5,000 2 = 5,000 - 10,000 3 = 10,001 - 25,000 4 = 25,001 - 50,000 5 = over 50,000  Bonus miles Number of miles earned from non-flight bonus transactions in the past 12 months. 
Bonus trans Number of non-flight bonus transactions in the past 12 months.  
Flight miles 12 Number of flight miles in the past 12 months.  Flight trans 12 Number of flight transactions in the past 12 months. 
Days since enrolled Number of days since enrolled in flier program.  
Award whether that person had award flight (free flight) or not. 

**Crime Dataset** 
Perform Clustering(Hierarchical, Kmeans &amp; DBSCAN) for the crime data and identify the number of clusters formed and draw inferences.
